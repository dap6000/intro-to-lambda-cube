# Contributing to this project.

I appreciate your interest in contributing to this project and I hope you're finding it useful. The main sort of contribution I want are bug reports:

 > If something didn't work right, I definitely want to hear about that. For now, Github issues work. Let me know the browser version you were using and the particular tag or commit of the project you're using. If you can reproduce the bug with a small HTML example, that would be great too.

However, there are some types of contributions I am unlikely to accept:

* CSS - The goal of this project is to make an HTML document behave like a slideshow. While you can do lots of neat things with CSS, including transition effects and making pretty slide shows, I really don't want that to be part of _this_ repository.

* Source code contributions - This project is open source, feel to use it, tweak it, and share your changes with the world. However, the actual source code is under 200 lines of JavaScript right now, and I would like to keep it short, sweet, and minimalist feature wise. So it is unlikely that I will accept a pull request.
