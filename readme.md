# Slideshow.js

Slideshow libraries for HTML slide shows are a dime a dozen. A lot of them are probably way more mature than this one, but I don't like how they package the CSS with them and incorporate theming and whatever. So I just wrote a really simple JS library to make <div>'s into slides that you navigate with the arrow keys. Styling is entirely separate (so make it look pretty or not, I don't care). Currently it uses jQuery because I was lazy, but I will eliminate that one day. I went ahead added [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) and it's CSS file since I am usually presenting about software development, so this does serve as a bit of a template to "fork" when I start writing a new deck of slides.
